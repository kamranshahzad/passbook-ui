# Passbook UI

## Description

I develop an application that manages passes/coupons using apple passbook server for smart phones. 
There are two components of this application. First component is a UI Plugin(Passbook-UI) which is developed for 
rdpress. This plugin provides the complete Interface for manage passes/coupons for users.

Second component is developed in Symfony2. That is a complete REST API which is integrated with Passbook-UI Plugin. 
All backend working done by PassbookBundle.
